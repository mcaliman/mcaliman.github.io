Well, you probably have different collations in some mysql views, try to force collation like this 
```sql  
SET character_set_client = 'utf8mb4';
SET character_set_connection = 'utf8mb4';
SET collation_connection = 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'; 

drop view if exists myviewwithproblem;
create view myviewwithproblem as â€¦ da da etc etc
```

obviously force to uft8 if you want this collation.
