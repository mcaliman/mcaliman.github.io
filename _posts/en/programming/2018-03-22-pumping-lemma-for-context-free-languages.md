# Lemma 
Given **L** a CF language `then` &exist; n&isin;**N**, 
n constant `so that` &forall; z&isin;L, \|z\|&ge;n so that we can decompose z=uvwxy `so that`
1 \|vwx\|&le;n
2 \|vx\|>0
3 &forall; i&ge;0 we have that uv&#8305;wx&#8305;y&isin;L

# Usage
One uses the lemma to prove that a language **is not** CF, to do so one must show, that fixed an arbitrary n
arbitrary, &exist; z&#8305;wx&#8305;y&notin;L \ \|z\&ge;n but `so that` for every possible decomposition such as uvwxy, with 1. and 2. constraints uv&#8305;wx&#8305;y&notin;L for some i&ge;0
