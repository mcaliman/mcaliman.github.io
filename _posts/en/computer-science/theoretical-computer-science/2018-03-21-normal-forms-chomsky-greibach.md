# Chomsky
All productions are of the form A::= BC or A::= &sigma;
(&sigma; &isin;T and A,B,C &isin;N).

Knowing them is important for various reasons, for instance they are used in the proof of correctness of lemma pumping for CF languages.


# Greibach
All productions are of the form A::= &sigma;B1...Bn 
(&sigma;&isin;T and A,B1,...,Bn &isin;N, n&ge;0).

One of the reasons to know them is that they are used in algorithms to switch from a CFG to a stack automaton (PDA).
