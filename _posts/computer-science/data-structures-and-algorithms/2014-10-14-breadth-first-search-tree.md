We start with the generic visitation algorithm and using a queue to represent `S` we obtain breadth-first visitation (Breadth First Search or BFS).

Nodes are visited by levels, first root, then children of the root, then children of the children.

```
algorithm BFS(node r)
   Queue C
   C.enqueue(r)
   while not C.isEmpty() do 
       u ← C.dequeue()
       if u ≠ null then
           visit(u)
           C.enqueue(leftChildOf(u))
           C.enqueue(rightChildOf(u))  
```
