BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) is a language based on `XML` built to formally describe business and industrial processes in a way that allows tasks to be divided between different actors, in practice it allows workflow processes to be defined using `XML`.
Normally a `BPEL` application is invoked as a web service, and interacts with the outside world only by invoking other web services. 
It represents a form of coordination of web services, allowing them to be composed recursively. 
The runtime environment within which the process runs is called the `BPEL` engine.
