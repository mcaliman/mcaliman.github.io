Here again, apt is more than generous 

```
$ sudo apt-get install subversion
```

We do not install with Apache because we will access svn via ssh in a much more secure way.
First, we create the directory that will host our project and repo

```
mkdir /var/svn/MyApplication
```

we "inform" svn that this directory is a repository

```
svnadmin create /var/svn/MyApplication
```

At this point from our favourite IDE, we can check out or initialise the repo when we have it locally, 
the repo URL is in the following format 

```
svn+ssh://svnserver/var/svn/MyApplication
```
