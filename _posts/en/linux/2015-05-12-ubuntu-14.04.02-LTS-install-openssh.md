Installing the OpenSSH server and client applications is simple. To install the OpenSSH client application on Ubuntu systems, use this command at a terminal prompt:

```
sudo apt-get install openssh-client
```

To install the OpenSSH server application and its supporting files, use this command at a terminal prompt:

```
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```

If the DHC assigns us a different IP each time, or it simply never occurred to us to need to know this detail about our home server, we need to retrieve it, for this purpose we use the command

```
$ ifconfig 
```

You don't need to be root and therefore use sudo to use it
we get the ip: 192.168.1.23

we can then try connecting from another machine with `ssh <username>@<hostip>`.
in my case
