An expert system is software that attempts to recreate the decision-making process of a human expert in a particular domain. Expert systems are often used in fields such as medicine, finance, and engineering, where rapid and complex decision-making is required.

Expert systems are composed of three main elements:

1. A knowledge base: the knowledge base contains the information that the expert system relies on to make its decisions. This information can include facts, rules, and procedures.
2. An inference engine: the inference engine is the component of the expert system that uses the knowledge base to make decisions. The inference engine uses a logical process to apply the rules to the knowledge base and generate a response.
3. A user interface: the user interface allows users to interact with the expert system. The user interface can be used to enter information, request information, or receive advice.
