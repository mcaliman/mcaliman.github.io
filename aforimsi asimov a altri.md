"The computer is a tool, like a hammer or a saw. It can be used for good or evil. It depends on the user." - Isaac Asimov, I, Robot (1950)

"Computers are not sentient beings. They do not have the same emotions and needs as humans. It is important to remember this when interacting with computers." - Isaac Asimov, The Foundation Trilogy (1951-1953)

"Computers are a powerful tool, but they are not a substitute for human intelligence. Computers can only do what they are programmed to do. It is up to humans to use computers wisely." - Isaac Asimov, The Robots of Dawn (1983)

"Computers are a part of our lives, but they are not our lives. It is important to remember this and to not let computers control us." - Isaac Asimov, The End of Eternity (1955)

"Computers are a tool that can be used for good or evil. It is up to us to decide how we want to use them." - Isaac Asimov, The Gods Themselves (1972)

"A computer is a tool that can be used for good or evil. It is up to us to decide how we want to use it." - Alan Turing

"The computer is a child of mathematics, and its potential for good or evil is a reflection of the potential for good or evil in mathematics itself." - John von Neumann

"The computer is a tool that can be used to automate tasks, but it cannot replace human ingenuity. It is up to humans to use the computer to create new things and solve new problems." - Edsger W. Dijkstra

"The computer is a tool that can be used to communicate and collaborate with others, but it cannot replace human interaction. It is up to humans to use the computer to build relationships and create communities." - Tim Berners-Lee

"The computer is a tool that can be used to learn and grow, but it cannot replace human education. It is up to humans to use the computer to access information and resources, and to develop their own critical thinking skills." - Bill Gates

"Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!" - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "A Discipline of Programming" (1976)

"The purpose of computing is to solve problems, and the primary measure of the value of a computing system is its ability to solve problems effectively." - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "A Discipline of Programming" (1976)

"The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence." - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "A Discipline of Programming" (1976)

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "A Discipline of Programming" (1976)

"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "A Discipline of Programming" (1976)

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "EWD 831" (1975)

"The first rule of debugging is: never change more than one variable at a time." - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "EWD 831" (1975)

"The second rule of debugging is: never change more than one line of code at a time." - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "EWD 831" (1975)

"The third rule of debugging is: never change more than one character at a time.
" - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "EWD 831" (1975)

"The fourth rule of debugging is: never change more than one bit at a time." - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "EWD 831" (1975)

"The fifth rule of debugging is: never change more than one nanosecond at a time." - Edsger W. Dijkstra, "EWD 831" (1975)
