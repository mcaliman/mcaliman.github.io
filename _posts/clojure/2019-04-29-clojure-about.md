> Simplicity is hard work. But, there's a huge payoff. The person who has a genuinely simpler system - a system made out of genuinely simple parts, is going to be able to affect the greatest change with the least work. He's going to kick your ass. He's gonna spend more time simplifying things up front and in the long haul he's gonna wipe the plate with you because he'll have that ability to change things when you're struggling to push elephants around.
-- **Rich Hickey**, Creator of the Clojure programming language.

The Clojure language, conceived and developed by [Rich Hickey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richhickey/it), is a dialect of the programming language [Lisp](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp).

The relationship with the Java platform is very close, Clojure can be compiled into Java bytecode and then run on the JVM. Clojure code can access Java code and libraries. 

In Clojure, code is data itself, allowing interactive development and macros.

Lisp, the language from which Clojure is derived, is a functional language, Clojure also supports the functional paradigm. The development of applications based on parallel computing and multithreading is greatly facilitated, compared to Java.  

Clojure is an open project, [Eclipse Public License 1.0](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) and is hosted on GitHub at [github.com/Clojure/clojure](github.com/clojure/clojure)

To make life easier for us with Clojure, we install Leiningen. 
[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) is an essential tool that creates, builds and automates Clojure projects.

For those who want to learn more and do not want to wait for future posts, I recommend the official website [clojure.org](https://clojure.org/)
