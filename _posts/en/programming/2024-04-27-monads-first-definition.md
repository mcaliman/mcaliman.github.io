In the world of functional programming, monads can be defined as **algebraic structures that encapsulate values and computations, providing a coherent interface for the management of computational contexts**. 

This definition, although more formal, maintains the essence of the monad concept as a container for values and behaviour. 

To highlight the structural and algebraic aspect of monads, we can use the following formulation:

* **A monad M is a triplet (T, η, μ) where:**
    * **T** is a functor
    * **η** is a natural isomorphism between the functor unit T and the empty object
    * **μ** is a bind operation

In some other fashion, the triplet (T, η, μ) defines the rules for the manipulation of values within the monad, ensuring consistent and uniform behaviour.

**Example:**

The monad **Maybe**, used to handle null values, can be defined as:

* **T(x) = x or None** (represents the encapsulated data type).
* **η(x) = Just x** (converts a normal value to a Maybe value)
* **μ(f, mx) = bind f mx** (combines a function f with a Maybe value mx)

This formal definition, although it may seem difficult at first sight, provides a solid basis for understanding the inner workings of monads and their power in functional programming
