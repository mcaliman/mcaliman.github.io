# Why learn Python? 
It is great for implementing or simply describing algorithms, in several university courses it has been chosen for its cleanliness, if you think about it, transforming pseudo-code that is normally used into Python code is quite straightforward.
Python is also widely used in science, I recommend a few books on the subject: 

* Python for Data Analysis, by Wes McKinney Ed. O'Reilly Media.
* Bioinformatics Programming Using Python "Natural Language Processing with Python

* Why learn the Java language? 
Because it's widespread, clean and completely OOP despite Edsger Dijkstra's thought "Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California." 

# Why learn C++? 
C++ is the prince of languages, you can use it to make anything. The Operating Systems, compilers, interpreters and Virtual Machines we use to run our code are written in C or C++.
