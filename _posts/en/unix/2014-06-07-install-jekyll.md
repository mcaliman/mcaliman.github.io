What we need

* Ruby.
* RubyGems.
* Ubuntu 14.04.

First, let's install Ruby.

```
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev make
```

We check the version of Ruby installed with the command.

```
ruby -v
```

To make sure everything works, you should obtain the following version of Ruby.
```
ruby 1.9.3p484 (2013-11-22 revision 43786) [x86_64-Linux]
```

A small workaround to fix the CoffeeScript gem... we need the g++ compiler...

```
sudo apt-get install g++
```

... and therubyracer.
```
sudo gem install therubyracer --nols-rdoc --no-ri
```


We finally install jekyll.

```
sudo gem install jekyll 
```

We check the installed version of Jekyll with the command.

```
jekyll -v
```

You should get something like that.
```
jekyll 2.0.3
```
