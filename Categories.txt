Of course, here are the subfields and branches of computer science in English:

Subfields of computer science:

Artificial intelligence: The study of intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.
Computer graphics: The study of the creation of images using computers.
Computer networks: The study of the design, construction, and operation of computer networks.
Computer security: The study of the prevention of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of computer systems and data.
Data science: The study of data and how to extract knowledge from it.
Databases: The study of the design, implementation, and management of databases.
Human-computer interaction: The study of how people interact with computers.
Information retrieval: The study of how to find information from a computer system.
Machine learning: The study of how computers can learn without being explicitly programmed.
Natural language processing: The study of how computers can understand and generate human language.
Operating systems: The study of the software that manages the resources of a computer system.
Programming languages: The study of the design, implementation, and application of programming languages.
Software engineering: The study of the design, development, and maintenance of software.
Branches of computer science:

Theoretical computer science: The study of the mathematical foundations of computer science.
Applied computer science: The application of computer science to real-world problems.

Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study of intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, including game playing, natural language processing, and medical diagnosis.

Computer graphics: Computer graphics is the study of the creation of images using computers. Computer graphics techniques are used in a wide variety of applications, including movies, video games, and medical imaging.

Computer networks: Computer networks are systems of computers that are connected together to share resources and information. Computer networking research focuses on the design, construction, and operation of computer networks.

Computer security: Computer security is the study of the prevention of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of computer systems and data. Computer security research focuses on developing techniques to protect computer systems from attack.

Data science: Data science is the study of data and how to extract knowledge from it. Data science techniques are used in a wide variety of applications, including business intelligence, marketing, and healthcare.

Databases: Databases are systems for storing and organizing data. Database research focuses on the design, implementation, and management of databases.

Human-computer interaction: Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. HCI research focuses on developing interfaces that are easy to use and effective.

Information retrieval: Information retrieval (IR) is the study of how to find information from a computer system. IR research focuses on developing techniques to search and retrieve information from large databases.

Machine learning: Machine learning is the study of how computers can learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning techniques are used in a wide variety of applications, including spam filtering, image recognition, and natural language processing.

Natural language processing: Natural language processing (NLP) is the study of how computers can understand and generate human language. NLP research focuses on developing techniques to process and understand natural language.

Operating systems: Operating systems are the software that manages the resources of a computer system. Operating systems research focuses on the design, implementation, and security of operating systems.

Programming languages: Programming languages are the languages that are used to write computer programs. Programming languages research focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of programming languages.

Software engineering: Software engineering is the study of the design, development, and maintenance of software. Software engineering research focuses on developing techniques to improve the quality, reliability, and efficiency of software.
