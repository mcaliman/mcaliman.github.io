Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of entity types called classes and objects. Java is an OOP language.

A class defines a model for components that share similar properties. An object is an instance of a class that implements its instructions.

Classes allow for the hierarchical structuring of information by providing encapsulation and restricting access and visibility. They also enable functional polymorphism, allowing for the implementation of methods with the same functionality but operating on different domains.
