The pattern interpreter is little used nowadays, there have been more powerful and ready-to-use tools for years 
if we need to provide our application with a scripting language or a real 
proper DSL (the Scala language for this purpose is extraordinarily effective). 
Its educational value is still considerable, learning how to make an interpreter
(however small and limited) add important knowledge to one's computing background, 
which, not by chance, are always covered in a university course (whether computer science or computer engineering).
