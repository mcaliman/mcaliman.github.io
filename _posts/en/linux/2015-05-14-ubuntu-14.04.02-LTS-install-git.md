Our new Linux server can also be very useful for making local, regular and systematic copies of our projects in a versioning system such as subversion (svn) or git. 
Let's start with git. Installing it will help us, for example, to make a scheduled checkout of what we have on github or another git server.
To install git we proceed as usual via apt

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

we check that everything is correctly installed with

```
$ git
```

without parameters. We need to do the initial setup of git to tell it who we are

```
sudo git config --global user.name "mcaliman"
sudo git config --global user.email "mcaliman@gmail.com"
```

check with

```
git config --list
```
