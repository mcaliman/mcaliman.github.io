If you happen to have to work in javascript, even if only to copy and paste simple scripts into your site, give yourself a gift,
buy and read "Java Script according to Peter-Paul Kock" (Pearson Education) translation of PPK ON JAVASCRIPT.
One of the few books on javascript that is not a reference or a mere collection of trivial scripts.
For those who don't know, Peter Paul Kock, better known as PPK, is one of the world's most authoritative experts on Javascript, 
the site www.quirksmode.org that many people know is his creation, I think it has been online for about ten years.
In the book, you will not find a collection of simple example scripts, didactic, of those that are copied everywhere by now, but real cases, for which the author has been paid,
it explains how to debug a script, how to use the most advanced techniques and how to avoid incompatibility problems between the various browsers as much as possible.
