AX-WS stands for Java API for XML Web Services.
JAX-WS is part of the Java EE platform of Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). Like other Java EE APIs, it uses annotations, introduced in Java SE 5, to simplify the development and deployment of web services clients.
The reference implementation of JAX-WS is developed as open source and is part of the GlassFish project, an open-source Java EE application server.
