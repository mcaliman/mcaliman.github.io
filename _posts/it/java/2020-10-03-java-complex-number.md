Does Java have an implementation for complex numbers? No, it doesn’t have a dedicated Class. It’s strange but not all that strange (Complex Number implementation is trivial), the JDK does not have one but here is an implementation I have written: 

[https://github.com/mcaliman/JavaComplexNumber](https://github.com/mcaliman/JavaComplexNumber)

However, there are third-party libraries for working with Complex, for example:

Apache Commons [http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/complex.html](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/complex.html)

My project is work in progress. Stay tuned! Next implementation: Generics, support for BigDecimal. What would you like me to add about?
