An inference engine is a component of an expert system that uses the knowledge base to make decisions. The inference engine uses a logical process to apply the rules to the knowledge base and generate a response.

The logical process used by the inference engine varies depending on the expert system. However, the common logical process used by all inference engines includes the following steps:

1. The inference engine starts by reading the knowledge base.
2. The inference engine applies the rules to the knowledge base.
3. The inference engine generates a response.
The response generated by the inference engine can be advice, a diagnosis, or a decision.

Inference engines are used in a variety of expert systems, including:

* Medical diagnosis systems
* Financial intelligence systems
* Engineering systems

Inference engines are a valuable tool for artificial intelligence. They allow expert  systems to make rapid and complex decisions, and they can be used in a variety of applications.
